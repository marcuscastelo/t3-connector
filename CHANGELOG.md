# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `t3_thread.pedidosPendentes` now exposes request IDs, public response capability,
  full user-input questions/options/field constraints, and approval prompts/provider
  decisions. Exact request-ID joins and field allowlists exclude native/session details
  and prior answers. Missing/invalid details and unsupported kinds have explicit
  fallback codes; shell-only pending requests remain visible. Read scopes and write
  authorization are unchanged.

- New read tool `t3_buscar_threads`: finds threads by title or exact ID without an
  environment, across every configured environment (or one, with `ambiente`). Each result
  carries `ambiente: {alias, environmentId, nome}`. Deadlines of 4 s per environment and
  10 s in total; environments that fail are listed in `falhasAmbientes` with
  `completa: false` instead of failing the search. Ambiguous matches are all returned,
  ordered by environment and thread ID, with a cursor bound to the environments that
  answered. Existing tools and write actions are unchanged and still take one environment.

## 0.5.0

First public release, as **T3 Connector**. Functionally equivalent to the previous
private 0.4.1, with these changes:

- Package, binaries and MCP server names renamed to `t3-connector` and
  `t3-connector-write`. Default paths are now `~/.config/t3-connector/config.json`,
  `~/.config/t3-connector/write.json` and `~/.local/state/t3-connector-write`; the
  environment variables are `T3_CONNECTOR_CONFIG`, `T3_CONNECTOR_WRITE_CONFIG` and
  `T3_CONNECTOR_CMD` (smoke test).
- MCP tool titles and descriptions, schema descriptions, guidance messages, the approval
  page and the documentation are in English. Tool names, parameters, response fields,
  error codes and configuration keys are unchanged.
- English CLI aliases: `environments`, `diagnose`, `--environment`, `--projects`.
- The `thread.launch` schema describes `modelSelection.instanceId` and `model` as exact
  IDs in the chosen environment, with no model enum or allowlist.
- Passkey registration labels (`rpName`, `userName`) are configurable in `write.json`
  (`passkey`), with neutral defaults (`T3 Connector`, `t3-connector`). The `rpID` remains
  `localhost`; passkeys already registered keep working.
- Examples, tests and ADRs carry no identifiers of real machines, projects or accounts.
- MIT license, security policy, CI and a package check (`npm pack`, isolated install,
  MCP handshake).

## Earlier history (summary)

- 0.4.x: search and cursor pagination in `t3_threads`/`t3_projetos`; explicit timing
  contract for `thread.send` (`steer_active`, `start_immediately`, `restart_active`,
  `queue_after_active` with explicit deferral).
- 0.3.x: writes routed per environment behind a passkey lease; reads resilient to SSH
  tunnel drops.
- 0.2.0: explicit environments, the connector's own SSH tunnel and `t3_aguardar_thread`.
- 0.1.0: read connector for a single environment.
